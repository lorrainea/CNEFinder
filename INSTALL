Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

   This installation requires the pre-installation of a C++ compiler, 
the cmake build system, and the libraries: boost.

For Linux, you can install these libraries via

 $ ./pre-install.sh 

Basic Instructions
==================

   The shell command `make -f Makefile' should compile this program
   for Linux Operating Systems.
 
   The shell command `make -f Makefile_M' should compile this program
   for Mac Operating Systems.
	 
   
After compilation the binary `cnef' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

 S ./cnef


Installation with CMake
=======================

CMake will automatically find the pre-installed softwares in your system:
C++ compiler with C++11 support, OpenMP, and Boost.
They can be installed easily with Homebrew:

    brew install cmake libomp boost

Then, you can install the latest version to an arbitrary `DESTINATION`:

    git clone https://github.com/lorrainea/CNEFinder.git
    cd CNEFinder/
    mkdir build
    cd build/
    DESTINATION=${HOME}/local
    cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=${DESTINATION} ..
    make -j4 install
